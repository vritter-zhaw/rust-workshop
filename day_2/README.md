# Day 2

Here's a checklist for this week's tasks:

## Practice

- Solve rustlings exercises.
  Watch out, one of the exercises for error handling requires something only covered next week.
  The solution is given below.
  - [x] structs
  - [x] enums
  - [x] strings
  - [x] modules
  - [x] hashmaps
  - [x] quiz 2
  - [x] options
  - [x] error_handling
    - In the exercise `errors5.rs`, the solution is `Box<dyn std::error::Error>>`.
- [ ] Solve the custom exercise for `methods`.
      Make sure you got it right by running `cargo test` in the `methods` directory.

## Homework

- [ ] Check out in "Rust By Example":
  - [Match Guards](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/match/guard.html)
  - [`HashSet`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std/hash/hashset.html)
- [ ] standard library
  - skim list of methods on `Option`
- [ ] Solve the exercise [Anagram](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/anagram) on Exercism.
- [ ] Solve Advent of Code [2016: day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1).

## Optional exercises

Just like last week, I simply encourage you to solve more exercises if you're having fun.
You should now know enough to solve basically any Advent of Code or Exercism exercise, so there's no explicit allow-list this time.
The advanced features of Rust we'll learn next week can be used for more elegant & performant solutions, but shouldn't generally be necessary.
Exercism has some advanced exercises that force you to use these advanced concepts, but if you solve the exercises in the natural order, you should be safe.

I also encourage you again to submit your exercise solutions to your workshop organizer for feedback!
